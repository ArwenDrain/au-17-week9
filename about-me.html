    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I earned my Bachelor's of Science from Missouri State University in Digital Film Production and recently completed the HTML and CSS 2-week courses from the Women's Coding Collective. In addition to taking the HTML5, CSS3 and Responsive Design Certificate through the University of Washington I will be persuing a Mastor's in International Relations starting December.</p>

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>To know me better, here is a taste of some interests of mine. I love to travel, before I entered collage I had already traveled around Europe. I recently quit my job to persue traveling. I spent a month traveling around Egypt. During my down time I watch Korean and Taiwanese dramas as well as some Bollywood. I also enjoy reading and learning new languages. I am currently learning Korean and Turkish.</p>
