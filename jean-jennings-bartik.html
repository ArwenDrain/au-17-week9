    <h2 class="text-info">Computer Girls</h2>
    <p>During and after World War II, Jean Jennings Bartik and other women worked as “computers.” They calculated the trajectories of military rockets and artillery shells by hand. Each weapon required a whole table of trajectories for the calculation, and each calculation took more than 30 hours.</p>
    <p>In 1945, Bartik applied for a new job, working with ENIAC. ENIAC was the first large-scale electronic computer whose operation wasn’t slowed down by mechanical parts. Men designed ENIAC , but the grueling and tedious task of creating programs for it was considered “women’s work,” akin to clerical labor. “Men were interested in building the hardware,” historian Walter Isaacson toldNPR. “Doing the circuits, figuring out the machinery. And women were very good mathematicians back then.” </p>
    <p>The night before ENIAC was to be first publicly demonstrated, it was malfunctioning and Bartik, with her colleague Betty Snyder set out to fix it. At the demonstration, ENIAC calculated the trajectory in 20 seconds—10 seconds less than it would take the actual shell to reach its target. The audience was “absolutely ecstatic,” Bartik told the Computer History Museum. Nevertheless, Bartik and Snyder went unnamed in press pictures, and they weren’t even invited to the celebration dinner.</p>

    <h2 class="text-info">Her Legacy</h2>
    <p>When the war was over, Bartik and other “ENIAC Girls” went to work with the UNIVAC, one of the first commercial computers. There they met Navy Reservist Grace Hopper.</p>
    <p>Hopper was looking for a way to make it easier to program computers with instructions. She discovered a method of programming a computer with words instead of numbers, and in 1959 created a programming language that basically allowed operators to give the computer commands in English. It was called COBOL.</p>
    <p>COBOL is still widely used today, especially by banks and governments. It runs on virtually any platform and is very adept with numbers. As such, it’s used in almost all business transactions. Every time you swipe a credit card or sell an investment security, COBOL is involved.</p>
